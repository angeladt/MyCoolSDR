My General Purpose SDR

I'd like to build a SDR someday, but first there is some design space
exploration to be done.
This repository holds various circuits that I stumbled upon and that I
wanted to simulate.
Every Circuit comes as an .asc file that I generated using LTSpice or as a
simple SPICE netlist.

If you 'd like to participate feel free to do so. Please do _NOT_ share any
circuits that you found in some companies reference manual etc... This is
about enjoying the technology and fooling around with it. There are pretty
amazing things to be discovered and explored like e.g. thermal noise
cancellation [1].

Why LTSpice? 
 - cause I like it
 - it can be downloaded free of charge
 - it is quite fast
 - it runs on linux using wine (faster than on my Win7)
